    RESTful Services with ASP.NET MVC
  |DevExpress|106,640 views|Uploaded on Nov 7, 2011| - Download: REST is the architecture of the Web, and RESTful Web services are now the most popular way of enabling browser-based applications to access information and behavior on Web servers.  In Web 2.0 applications, desktop-like responsiveness and versatility are driven by client-side script code, and RESTful services with JavaScript-friendly request and response formats vastly simplify this kind of code.  Open source frameworks like Rails have historically made the server side of these services correspondingly straightforward to implement, but the .NET community hasn't benefitted from this kind of work until recently.  Now, however, ASP.NET MVC (itself an open source project), along with the modest assistance of some other open-source tools and conventions, makes it easy to write full-featured RESTful Web services.  We'll explore REST itself, what RESTful Web services look like, and how to write them using the MVC framework along with Steve Hodgkiss's RESTful Routing library.If you have any questions, please feel free to reach our support center at|https://yt3.ggpht.com/-1_Tid6nNlTw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/HVyUbz8_lxU/s88-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRhyn45o3qE|https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtOjyugQSbxjQGuimGVsLVg|26,601|215|14

Server control events can be classified into 3 categories.Postback events - These events submit the Web page, immediately to the server for processing. Click event of a button control is an example for Post Back event.Cached events - These events are saved in the page's view state to be processed when a postback event occurs. TextChanged event of TextBox control, and SelectedIndexChanged event of a DropDownList control are examples of cached events. Cached events can be converted into post back events, by setting the AutoPostBack property of the control to true.Validation events - These events occur on the client, before the page is posted back to the server. All validation controls use these type of events.|https://yt3.ggpht.com/-yNezR9CknQM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/StDlZWYS_CU/s88-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlxyiO6HWbU|https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCTVrRB5KpIiK6V2GGVsR1Q|212,703|325|9

    What is the use of JavaScript in ASP NET
  |kudvenkat|226,160 views|Published on Oct 27, 2014|Link for all dot net and sql server video tutorial playlistsLink for slides, code samples and text version of the videoIn this video we will discuss 1. The use of JavaScript in a web application. 2. Advantages of using JavaScriptRun the application. Leave all the fields blank and click the Submit button. The form is posted to the web server, the server validates the form and since all the fields are required fields the user is presented with error messages.In this case the form validation is done on the server. Just to validate the form, there is a round trip between the client browser and the web server. The request has to be sent over the network to the web server for processing. This means if the network is slow or if the server is busy processing other requests, the end user may have to wait a few seconds.Isn't there a way to validate the form on the client side.Yes, we can and that's when we use JavaScript. JavaScript runs on the client broswer. For the Submit button set OnClientClick="return ValidateForm()". This calls the JavaScript ValidateForm() function. The JavaScript code runs on the client browser and validates the form fields. If the fields are left blank the user is presented with an error message right away. This is much faster because there is no round trip between the client and the web server. This also means the load on the server is reduced, and we are using the client machine processing power. If all the form fields are populated the form will be submitted to the server and the server saves the data to the database table.What are the advantages of using JavaScript1. Form validation can be done on the client side, which reduces the unnecessary round trips between the client and the server. This also means the load on the server is reduced and the application is more responsive.2. JavaScript uses the client machine processing power.3. With JavaScript partial page updates are possible i.e only portions of the page can be updated, without reloading the entire web form. This is commonly called as AJAX.4. JavaScript can also be used to animate elements on a page. For example, show or hide elements and sections of the page.|https://yt3.ggpht.com/-yNezR9CknQM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/StDlZWYS_CU/s88-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMsVM7rjupU|https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCTVrRB5KpIiK6V2GGVsR1Q|212,703|386|10
